IrcNotify
=========

IRC bot that listens for messages and displays alerts in the windows notification area.


TODO
====
Support for several channels? servers? networks? Possibly interface for configurating this?

Support for dynamic listeners? (e.g. This regex decides if this should alert, this other extracts message parts, here is the priority order.)
